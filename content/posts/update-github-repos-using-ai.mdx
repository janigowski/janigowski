# Intro

When you're managing multiple GitHub repositories, changing ownership can become a tedious task. Whether you're rebranding, moving projects between organizations, or just keeping things organized, doing it manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Instead of writing the script from scratch, I decided to leverage ChatGPT to help me create a solution.

# The AI-Assisted Development Process

I started by crafting a clear, detailed prompt for ChatGPT. Here's what I asked:

```prompt
Write a bash script that:

1. Iterates through all directories in the current directory.
2. Checks if a directory is a git repository.
3. If the git repository has an `origin` remote URL owned by a parameterized user (e.g., `john`), updates the owner in the URL to another parameterized user (e.g., `betty`) using `git remote set-url`.
4. Logs each directory iteration in the following formats:
   - For updated repositories:  
     `directory name: changed git origin from "git@github.com:john/REPOSITORY.git" to "git@github.com:betty/REPOSITORY.git"`
   - For repositories not owned by the current owner:  
     `directory name: is not owned by "john"`
   - For non-git directories:  
     `directory name: is not a git repository`
5. Includes a `--dry-run` parameter to simulate the process without making actual changes, logging what would be done instead of executing it.
```

The prompt is specific about:
- The exact functionality needed
- The expected output format
- Safety features like dry-run mode
- Error handling cases

This level of detail helped ChatGPT understand exactly what I needed and generate a script that required minimal modifications.

# The Solution

The AI generated a script that automates the process of updating GitHub repository ownership. Let's break down the key components before looking at the complete solution.

## Script Configuration

First, we define our parameters and handle the dry-run mode:

```bash
# Parameters for current and new git remote owners
current_owner="dawidjaniga"
new_owner="janigowski"

# Dry-run parameter
dry_run=false

# Check for dry-run flag
if [[ "$1" == "--dry-run" ]]; then
    dry_run=true
    echo "Running in dry-run mode: No changes will be made."
fi
```

## Directory Processing

The script processes each directory and checks if it's a git repository:

```bash
for dir in */; do
    echo "Processing directory: $dir"

    if [ -d "$dir/.git" ]; then
        cd "$dir" || continue
        # Process repository...
    else
        echo "$dir: is not a git repository"
    fi
done
```

## Repository Update Logic

For each git repository, we check ownership and update if needed:

```bash
current_origin=$(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null)

if [[ $current_origin == git@github.com:$current_owner/* ]]; then
    repo_name=$(basename "$current_origin" .git)
    new_origin="git@github.com:$new_owner/$repo_name.git"
    
    if $dry_run; then
        echo "$dir: would change git origin from \"$current_origin\" to \"$new_origin\""
    else
        git remote set-url origin "$new_origin"
        echo "$dir: changed git origin from \"$current_origin\" to \"$new_origin\""
    fi
fi
```

## Complete Script

Here's the complete script that puts it all together:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Parameters for current and new git remote owners
current_owner="dawidjaniga"
new_owner="janigowski"

# Dry-run parameter
dry_run=false

# Check for dry-run flag
if [[ "$1" == "--dry-run" ]]; then
    dry_run=true
    echo "Running in dry-run mode: No changes will be made."
fi

# Iterate through all directories in the current directory
for dir in */; do
    # Log the directory being processed
    echo "Processing directory: $dir"

    # Check if the directory is a git repository
    if [ -d "$dir/.git" ]; then
        # Navigate to the directory
        cd "$dir" || continue

        # Get the current git remote URL for 'origin'
        current_origin=$(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null)

        if [[ $current_origin == git@github.com:$current_owner/* ]]; then
            # Extract the repository name from the URL
            repo_name=$(basename "$current_origin" .git)

            # Update the git remote URL to point to the new owner
            new_origin="git@github.com:$new_owner/$repo_name.git"
            if $dry_run; then
                # Log the intended change without making it
                echo "$dir: would change git origin from \"$current_origin\" to \"$new_origin\""
            else
                git remote set-url origin "$new_origin"
                # Log the change
                echo "$dir: changed git origin from \"$current_origin\" to \"$new_origin\""
            fi
        else
            # Log if the repository is not owned by the current owner
            echo "$dir: is not owned by \"$current_owner\""
        fi

        # Return to the parent directory
        cd - > /dev/null || exit
    else
        # Log if the directory is not a git repository
        echo "$dir: is not a git repository"
    fi
done
```

# How to Use It

1. Save the script as `update_git_remotes.sh`
2. Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x update_git_remotes.sh
```

3. Test it with dry-run mode:
```bash
./update_git_remotes.sh --dry-run
```

4. When you're confident with the changes, run it for real:
```bash
./update_git_remotes.sh
```

# Working with AI: Tips from This Experience

1. **Be Specific**: The more detailed your prompt, the better the output. Notice how I specified exact output formats and error cases.
2. **Request Safety Features**: Always ask for safety measures like dry-run modes when dealing with system changes.
3. **Include Error Handling**: Specify how different edge cases should be handled.
4. **Test First**: Even with AI-generated code, always test in a safe environment first.

# Final Thoughts

Using ChatGPT to write this script saved me time in two ways: it generated the initial code quickly, and the quality of the generated code meant I spent less time debugging and modifying. The script has saved me hours of manual work and reduced the risk of mistakes when updating repository ownership.

Remember to always use the dry-run mode first, especially when dealing with multiple repositories. It's better to be safe than sorry!
