As a **software architect** and **product engineer**, I've always believed that the biggest challenges in creating great products aren't technical—they're communicational. In my years of building and studying software, I've seen time and time again how clarity of communication determines the success of a project. Recently, this insight has become even more relevant in an unexpected area: working with <Keyword>AI assistants</Keyword> like ChatGPT or Cursor.

## From Chaos to Clarity: The Restaurant Analogy

Imagine walking into a restaurant, sitting down, and telling the waiter, "I want to eat." What do you think would happen? Likely, you'd get a confused look. Instead, we study the menu, consider our preferences, and communicate clearly what we'd like to order.

This process mirrors how we should approach **AI interactions**. Just as we tailor our language and abstraction level to different team members—technical jargon for engineers, high-level metaphors for product designers—we need to do the same with **AI**. **Communication** is the bridge to results, whether with humans or machines.

## Why This Matters

The results I've achieved with **AI assistants** improved dramatically when I began treating them like team members. Instead of vague instructions like "Add new feature to drag the needle", I started combining User Stories ("As an artist, I want to precisely seek audio by dragging") with technical context like event handlers, state management, and architectural patterns.

## The EXO_LAB Story

In [EXØ_LAB](/projects/exo-lab), a digital audio-visual performance platform I founded, I recently faced an issue with the Timeline component. If you've worked with tools like Adobe Premiere Pro or Ableton, you'll be familiar with the concept: dragging a playhead (or needle) to navigate through a timeline. In EXO, this feature is controlled by multiple inputs—mouse, keyboard, and MIDI devices. I encapsulated this functionality as a Use Case using the <Keyword>Command Pattern</Keyword> to ensure the architecture supports extensibility. You can see a practical example of this approach in my article about [multichannel audio output](/posts/multichannel-audio-output), where I discuss similar architectural patterns.

When I asked Cursor, running Claude Sonnet 3.5, to resolve a bug, it provided a working solution—but with a critical flaw. The fix was implemented directly in the <Keyword>Needle component</Keyword>'s event handler. For less experienced engineers, this might appear acceptable. The code worked. But it violated one of my core architectural drivers: **extensibility**. This is what I call a "false positive."

### A Conversation with Cursor

Here's where things got interesting. I asked Cursor if it was confident about the placement of the changes and whether it had considered the <Keyword>SOLID principles</Keyword>. It apologized and quickly adjusted its solution. The new implementation:

- Delegated user events (e.g., DragStart, Dragging, DragEnd) to a <Keyword>Timeline Controller</Keyword>.
- Allowed the Timeline Controller to calculate the new timeline position.
- Relayed this to the PerformanceView, which evaluated the correct response—like toggling play/pause to avoid audio artifacts.
- Invoked the <Keyword>Seek Use Case</Keyword> in the application core.

By communicating with Cursor as I would with a seasoned engineer, I achieved a clean, extensible solution that aligned with the <Keyword>Open-Closed Principle</Keyword>.

## What This Means for AI Era Developers

This example highlights three important lessons:

1. **Precision matters.** Treat your communication with AI assistants as you would with teammates. Provide context, architectural constraints, and clear goals. I've applied this approach successfully in [updating GitHub repositories using AI](/posts/update-github-repos-using-ai).
2. **AI needs guidance.** A solution that works isn't always the right one. Without explicit instructions, AI may violate your project's architectural drivers.
3. **Knowledge is your compass.** Concepts like <Keyword>software modeling</Keyword>, design principles, and application architecture become critical tools for steering AI in the right direction. For a deeper dive into these principles, check out my review of [Design It!](/library/michael-keeling-design-it) by Michael Keeling.

## Becoming Captains of the AI Ship

If I were to use a metaphor, I'd say we, as software creators, are the captains of a ship. The **chat interface** is our steering wheel, and AI is the ship. To navigate effectively, we must know our destination and understand the conditions that influence our journey.

## Next Steps for You

In this new <Keyword>AI-driven era</Keyword>, honing your understanding of software principles and communication skills is more important than ever. By reading books and articles on topics like software design and product management, you can expand your vocabulary and refine your ability to direct AI. If you're looking for recommendations, check out my curated list in [Library](/library).

Let's embrace this era with the precision and care it demands. After all, the better we communicate, the better our results—whether with humans or AI.
