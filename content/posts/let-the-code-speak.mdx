## Seeing Code in Action

When we write code, we often want to *see* what's happening step by step. Whether it's tracking variables, following execution flow, or troubleshooting unexpected behavior, logging is usually the first instinct.

The most straightforward way? **`console.log()`**â€”a trusted old friend. Drop it into your code, run your app, and watch the logs roll in. Simple, effective... until it isn't.

### The Limits of `console.log()`

While `console.log()` is easy to use, it quickly gets messy:

- Cluttering the output with unnecessary logs
- Having to manually comment out or remove logs before committing
- No easy way to control what gets logged without modifying the code

There's a better way. A **future-proof** way. Enter: **`debug`**.

## Introducing `debug` â€“ A Smarter Way to Log

[`debug`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) is a lightweight logging package that gives you **control over what speaks** in your applicationâ€”without modifying the code. It works similarly to `console.log()`, but with a key difference: **selective visibility**.

### How It Works

Instead of using `console.log()`, you create named debugging instances:

```javascript
import debug from 'debug';

const log = debug('app:core');

log('This is a debug message!');
```

By default, nothing shows up. But when you run your app with the `DEBUG` environment variable set, you control which logs are displayed:

```bash
DEBUG=app:* node index.js
```

Now you see only relevant logs, keeping your output clean.

`debug` runs in both: browser and node.js.

If you want for example to see almost all logs but not the `updater` module you can use:

```bash
DEBUG=app:*,-app:updater node index.js
```

Check out the [debug docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) for more examples.

## Real-World Example: `express`

A prime example of `debug` in action is within the popular [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework. Express uses `debug` extensively to provide detailed internal logging.

In the [Express application file](https://github.com/expressjs/express/blob/master/lib/application.js), you'll find:

```javascript
import debug from 'debug';

const log = debug('express:application');
```

This line sets up a debug instance named `express:application`. Throughout the file, `log` is called to log various internal events and states. To see these logs, you can run your application with the `DEBUG` environment variable set:

```bash
DEBUG=express:* node yourApp.js
```

This enables you to gain insights into Express's internal workings without altering its source code.

## Two Perspectives on Using `debug`

1. **Introducing `debug` in Your Projects**

   - **Selective Logging**: Control which parts of your app "speak" without modifying the code. Need to focus on a specific module? Just tweak `DEBUG=module:*`.
   - **Better for Production Code**: Unlike `console.log()`, which you'll eventually need to clean up, `debug` lets you ship code with built-in logging that clients can enable if needed.
   - **Lightweight and Non-Intrusive**: If `DEBUG` isn't set, `debug` remains silentâ€”no extra noise, no performance hit.

2. **Leveraging `debug` in External Projects**

   Many popular npm packages utilize `debug` for their internal logging. By enabling `debug` for these packages, you can gain deeper insights into their operations, which is invaluable for troubleshooting and understanding behavior.

   To enable debugging for a specific package, set the `DEBUG` environment variable to the appropriate namespace. For example, to see all internal logs used in Express, set `DEBUG=express:*` when launching your app:

   ```bash
   DEBUG=express:* node yourApp.js
   ```

   This approach allows you to tap into the internal workings of your dependencies without altering their code.

## Popular npm Packages Using `debug` in Modern JavaScript Frameworks

The `debug` package is widely adopted across the Node.js ecosystem, including many modern frameworks and libraries. Here are some notable examples:

1. **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
2. **Nuxt.js**: A framework for creating Vue.js applications with server-side rendering.
3. **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.
4. **Sapper**: A framework for building Svelte applications with server-side rendering.
5. **Gatsby**: A React-based open-source framework for creating websites and apps.
6. **Electron**: A framework for building cross-platform desktop applications with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
7. **React Native**: A framework for building native apps using React.
8. **Vue CLI**: A standard tooling for Vue.js development.
9. **Angular CLI**: A command-line interface tool to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications.
10. **TypeORM**: An ORM for TypeScript and JavaScript (ES7, ES6, ES5) that supports many database systems.

For a comprehensive list of packages that depend on `debug`, you can visit the [npm dependents page](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/debug).

That means you can run each of these packages with `debug` enabled and see their internals without altering their code.

## Conclusion

Let your code *speak*, but make sure it speaks **when it matters**. While `console.log()` is great for quick debugging, **`debug` is the smarter, more maintainable choice**â€”especially for scalable applications and shared libraries.

Next time you're about to sprinkle `console.log()` everywhere, ask yourself: *Do I want this message to be permanent?* If the answer is *yes*, give `debug` a try. ðŸš€
