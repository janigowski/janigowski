title: Mars Explorer
description: Mars Explorer allows to scan through photos taken by NASA rovers on Mars. Photos are placed in one place as animation. Technologically, I wanted to know how does it feel to code multi-store React application. I used react-sweet-state with great pleasure to achieve that.
