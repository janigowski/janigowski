title: Wikipedia Map
description: I love to roam on Wikipedia. And on Google Maps. Oftentimes I coulnd't found much information about the places I would like to visit. I started to think about creating a map on which Wikipedia articles with attached coordinates could be displayed.

I use Wikipedia Map as the concept to teach > 20 people how to use React. That was 5 days online workshop organized by the company I worked at the time - Netguru.
