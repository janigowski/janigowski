## The Beginning
From the moment I could hold a screwdriver, I was dismantling remote-controlled cars just to see how they worked. My first computer opened up a whole new world—spending hours exploring music from around the globe (yes, via P2P—shame on me). My love for science, art, and technology was set in motion. 

Art was always close to home. My mom's beautiful reproduction of Van Gogh's *Café Terrace at Night* still hangs in our living room, while my uncle's paintings and photographs adorned the walls. By the age of 10, I knew these passions would guide me.

Programming entered my life soon after, and it felt like a form of <Keyword>art</Keyword> in itself—a creative outlet where logic meets imagination. Over time, my twin passions evolved: <Keyword>art</Keyword> into graphic design, DJing, and music composition; and <Keyword>technology</Keyword> into software architecture and creative development. The inevitable dream?

To unite these worlds into something extraordinary.

## The Problem
As a solo <Keyword>artist</Keyword>, I craved a way to perform in a DJ-like fashion, weaving together tracks, visuals, and emotions to craft a unique experience for my audience. Yet, I lacked the tools to express my vision. 

Through research, I found most performances relied on multiple programs and teams: a DJ for music, a VJ for visuals, and technicians for lighting. For solo artists like me, the setup felt fragmented and overwhelming.

I also didn't want to compete with the entire teams behind the biggest productions. Instead, I wanted to enable their capabilities for those who share my vision of creating immersive, multi-sensory experiences. I didn't want to replicate existing tools; I wanted a solution tailored for <Keyword>new media artists</Keyword>, empowering them to unify their creative processes in a seamless way.

## Key Features

### Advanced Audio Management
- Professional-grade audio processing with [multichannel audio support](/posts/multichannel-audio-output)
- Real-time waveform visualization  
- Multi-channel mixing with BPM synchronization  

### Visual Performance Integration
- Timeline-based control of lights, stroboscopes, lasers, and more using the DMX standard.  
- No reliance on specific brands—EXØ_LAB is designed to integrate with stage equipment universally.  

### 2-Way MIDI Integration with Human-Readable Names  
EXØ_LAB simplifies MIDI device integration in ways traditional tools don't:  
- Human-readable control mappings: Buttons and knobs appear in the interface as they are labeled on the hardware (e.g., "A", "B", "Layer" on Allen & Heath K2). No cryptic MIDI notes or channels.  
- Version-controlled mappings: Experiment freely with new mappings without losing previous configurations.  
- Powered by WebMIDI, ensuring smooth hardware-software interaction.

### Context-Dependent Shortcuts for MIDI and Keyboard  
The platform introduces **view-aware shortcuts**, dynamically adapting controls to the active interface:  
- In **Perform Mode**, MIDI controllers light up buttons relevant to live performance.  
- Switch to the **"Add New Item" view**, and both functionality and visual feedback change, ensuring seamless navigation and usability.  

### Spotlight: Execute Ideas at the Speed of Light  
Inspired by **MacOS Spotlight**, this command palette makes it effortless to:  
- Navigate sections (`go tracks`, `go visuals`)  
- Execute creative actions (e.g., synchronize videos to a beat, adjust lighting colors).  
Spotlight eliminates interruptions, letting ideas flow directly onto the canvas.

### Timeline: The Backbone of EXØ_LAB  
The timeline is designed for precision and performance, supporting multi-type channels to handle audio, video, visuals, and lighting in a single interface. Read about how we solved [timeline component challenges using AI](/posts/ai-communication#the-exo_lab-story).  
- **High-performance rendering** ensures smooth operation, even with many items loaded.  
- A **Minimap** offers a bird's-eye view of the entire performance, making it easy to navigate complex shows.  
- All timeline tools are fully controllable via **MIDI devices, keyboard, and mouse**, providing flexibility to match each artist's workflow.

### Extensible by Design  
EXØ_LAB is built with extensibility in mind. Artists and developers can:  
- Integrate hardware like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or ART-Net controllers
- Use APIs or WebSockets to connect external services
- Access resources from platforms like Unsplash or Freesound directly within the app, bypassing manual imports.
