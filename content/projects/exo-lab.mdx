**TL;DR:**  
EXØ_LAB is my passion project—a desktop application designed to empower new media artists by unifying audio, video, and lighting tools into a single extensible platform. It bridges art and technology with features like context-aware MIDI control, intuitive mappings, and Spotlight for streamlined workflows. This post shares the journey behind the idea, its vision, and an invitation to collaborate or connect.

From the moment I could hold a screwdriver, I was dismantling remote-controlled cars just to see how they worked. My first computer opened up a whole new world—spending hours exploring music from around the globe (yes, via P2P—shame on me). My love for **science**, **art**, and **technology** was set in motion. 

Art was always close to home. My mom’s beautiful reproduction of Van Gogh’s *Café Terrace at Night* still hangs in our living room, while my uncle’s paintings and photographs adorned the walls. By the age of 10, I knew these passions would guide me.

Programming entered my life soon after, and it felt like **a form of art in itself**—a creative outlet where logic meets imagination. Over time, my twin passions evolved: **art** into graphic design, DJing, and music composition; and **technology** into software architecture and creative development. The inevitable dream?

To unite these worlds into something extraordinary.

As a solo artist, I craved a way to **perform in a DJ-like fashion**, weaving together tracks, visuals, and emotions to craft a unique experience for my audience. Yet, I lacked the tools to express my vision. 

Through research, I found most performances relied on **multiple programs and teams**: a DJ for music, a VJ for visuals, and technicians for lighting. For solo artists like me, the setup felt fragmented and overwhelming. 

I also didn’t want to compete with the **entire teams** behind the biggest productions. Instead, I wanted to **enable their capabilities** for those who share my vision of creating immersive, multi-sensory experiences. I didn’t want to replicate existing tools; I wanted a solution tailored for **new media artists**, empowering them to unify their creative processes in a seamless way.

## Introducing EXØ_LAB

EXØ_LAB is the result of this vision—a desktop application that unifies audio, visual, and lighting tools into one cohesive platform. It’s not just for DJs, VJs, or producers, but for **artists who want to create experiences**.  

While still in development, EXØ_LAB focuses on bridging gaps between existing tools and making advanced creative workflows intuitive, extensible, and artist-friendly. Here's a glimpse into some of its standout features:

## Key Features

### Advanced Audio Management
- Professional-grade audio processing  
- Real-time waveform visualization  
- Multi-channel mixing with BPM synchronization  

### Visual Performance Integration
- Timeline-based control of lights, stroboscopes, lasers, and more using the **DMX standard**.  
- No reliance on specific brands—EXØ_LAB is designed to integrate with stage equipment universally.  

### 2-Way MIDI Integration with Human-Readable Names  
EXØ_LAB simplifies MIDI device integration in ways traditional tools don’t:  
- **Human-readable control mappings**: Buttons and knobs appear in the interface as they are labeled on the hardware (e.g., "A", "B", "Layer" on Allen & Heath K2). No cryptic MIDI notes or channels.  
- **Version-controlled mappings**: Experiment freely with new mappings without losing previous configurations.  
- Powered by **WebMIDI**, ensuring smooth hardware-software interaction.

### Context-Dependent Shortcuts for MIDI and Keyboard  
The platform introduces **view-aware shortcuts**, dynamically adapting controls to the active interface:  
- In **Perform Mode**, MIDI controllers light up buttons relevant to live performance.  
- Switch to the **"Add New Item" view**, and both functionality and visual feedback change, ensuring seamless navigation and usability.  

### Spotlight: Execute Ideas at the Speed of Light  
Inspired by **MacOS Spotlight**, this command palette makes it effortless to:  
- Navigate sections (`go tracks`, `go visuals`)  
- Execute creative actions (e.g., synchronize videos to a beat, adjust lighting colors).  
Spotlight eliminates interruptions, letting ideas flow directly onto the canvas.

### Extensible by Design  
EXØ_LAB is built with extensibility in mind. Artists and developers can:  
- Integrate hardware like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or ART-Net controllers.  
- Use APIs or WebSockets to connect external services.  
- Access resources from platforms like Unsplash or Freesound directly within the app, bypassing manual imports.
