From the moment I could hold a screwdriver, I was dismantling remote-controlled cars just to see how they worked. My first computer opened up a whole new world—spending hours exploring music from around the globe (yes, via P2P—shame on me). My love for **science**, **art**, and **technology** was set in motion. 

Art was always close to home. My mom’s beautiful reproduction of Van Gogh’s *Café Terrace at Night* still hangs in our living room, while my uncle’s paintings and photographs adorned the walls. By the age of 10, I knew these passions would guide me.

Programming entered my life soon after, and it felt like **a form of art in itself**—a creative outlet where logic meets imagination. Over time, my twin passions evolved: **art** into graphic design, DJing, and music composition; and **technology** into software architecture and creative development. The inevitable dream? To unite these worlds into something extraordinary.

As a solo artist, I craved a way to **perform in a DJ-like fashion**, weaving together tracks, visuals, and emotions to craft a unique experience for my audience. Yet, I lacked the tools to express my vision. 

Through research, I found most performances relied on **multiple programs and teams**: a DJ for music, a VJ for visuals, and technicians for lighting. For solo artists like me, the setup felt fragmented and overwhelming. 

I also didn’t want to compete with the **entire teams** behind the biggest productions. Instead, I wanted to **enable their capabilities** for those who share my vision of creating immersive, multi-sensory experiences. I didn’t want to replicate existing tools; I wanted a solution tailored for **new media artists**, empowering them to unify their creative processes in a seamless way.

**EXØ_LAB** was born as the answer to this challenge—a desktop application combining the best of **audio, visual, and performance tools** into one cohesive platform. Not just for DJs, VJs, or music producers, but for **artists who want to create experiences**.

Here’s how EXØ_LAB bridges the gap:

### Operating Modes: Prepare and Perform  
Drawing inspiration from tools like **DaVinci Resolve**, where artists work through distinct phases such as *Media*, *Cut*, *Edit*, *Fusion*, *Color*, *Fairlight*, and *Deliver*, EXØ_LAB introduces two modes of operation:  

#### **Prepare Mode**  
In this mode, artists can focus on sourcing and refining materials for their performance:  
- **Audio**: Select tracks, label them, align beatgrids, normalize loudness, and add emotion descriptions.  
- **Video**: Loop, trim, and label clips for seamless integration.  
- **Lights**: Design lighting scenarios and stage device sequences tailored to the performance.  

This phase ensures every element of the performance is polished and ready for seamless integration.  

#### **Perform Mode**  
Designed for live execution, Perform Mode provides a **stage-prepared UI** optimized for distance viewing and hands-on control with **audio mixers** and **MIDI devices**.  
- Artists can start from a **blank canvas** or use their curated materials—tracks, visuals, and lighting setups—to craft the experience in real-time.  
- With intuitive controls, performers can focus on delivering an immersive journey, blending pre-prepared elements with spontaneous creativity.

### Spotlight: Execute Ideas at the Speed of Light  
Inspired by **MacOS Spotlight**, EXØ_LAB’s command palette ensures an artist’s vision flows effortlessly onto the canvas.  

- Need to **navigate to a specific section** of your project? Just type commands like `go tracks`, `go visuals`, or `go lights`.  
- Want to **synchronize five videos to the beat** in sequence? Done in seconds.  
- Planning to **set the venue to glow green for a particular moment**? The command is yours to execute.  

Spotlight transforms the creative process into an uninterrupted flow, allowing artists to work as quickly as their imagination unfolds.
