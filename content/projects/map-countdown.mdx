A few years ago, I worked on a website for a running event and came up with a cool idea: a date counter that shows the race route on a map, animated by the second.

I ended up creating an open-source library for it. It includes a Google Maps wrapper for displaying the route and a CLI tool to parse .tcx GPS files into a map-friendly format.

The project was challenging but also really fun.
