🚀 Żappka Click & Collect – Scaling Innovation & Delivery

I led event storming sessions to align engineering with product goals, uncovering the need for a strategic refactor. By eliminating 1,500+ LOC and moving state management to the URL, I enabled robust E2E testing and transitioned from weekly to multiple daily deployments.

This fast iteration cycle let us validate a critical set of new features on time, empowering the company to make strategic business decisions. Additionally, I optimized map loading time from 10s to 2s, which significantly reduced bounce rates and improved user engagement.

📈 Impact:
✔️ Faster product validation, leading to data-driven strategic decisions
✔️ Optimized performance, reducing friction & increasing user retention
✔️ Scalable, high-velocity delivery, improving business agility
